      Title: Great laptop, minor complaint
      
      The CloudBook Pro is amazing for my development work. The screen is crisp and the keyboard is a joy to type on. My only issue is that the battery life, while good, doesn't quite live up to the advertised 12 hours. I'm getting closer to 8-9 hours with my typical workload. I would still recommend it.

      Product: Mechanic Keyboard
      Date Opened: 2023-01-22

      Issue: My Mechanic Keyboard arrived with a sticky left shift key. It's really hard to press. I've tried cleaning it but it doesn't help. Can I get a replacement sent out?
